Based on reviews, I somehow imagined this would be a better product than it is. Visions of some IKEA-ish product filled my head. Unfortunately this is embarrassingly cheap looking with highly doubtful longevity. It reminds me of the put together stuff you see on display in a Walmart for 99.99. Returning it would be our choice however the boxes were ruined between shipping and unpacking. The hassle of disassembly and repacking would also add to time wasted on this. So here I sit with a pile of wobbly metal and glass wanting it gone ASAP.
